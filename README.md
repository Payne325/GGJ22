# Panda Dating Simulator - Turbo Arcade Edition
A GGJ2022 submission.

- Team: Alex Payne, Simon Titcomb, Christopher Light, Marco Dias 

## Gameplay
You are Cupid, and your job is to maintain the balance between the number of pandas alive in the field and the amount of bamboo that exists to feed them all. Use the arrow keys to move cupid, and press SPACE to pick up and throw pandas around. When Pandas are near each other, they will fall in love and a stork will arrive with a new panda. The more pandas you have, the faster the bamboo will run out, so be careful.
